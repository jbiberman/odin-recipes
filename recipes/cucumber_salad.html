    <h1>Quick Cucumber Salad</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cucumbers are a great summer food, and in Beijing, theyâ€™re actually a common snack. When you take a walk in the park or head out to a tourist attraction or other landmark, you can see people just gnawing on fresh cucumbers as they walk. Impressed by this healthy habit, I purchased one from the local vendor in the park for 1 RMB, doing as the Chinese do. It tasted fresh and healthy, but if you want to pump up the flavor, try this quick recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            3 medium cucumbers
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 tsp salt
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 tsp sugar
        </li>
        <li>
            1/8 tsp ground white pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tsp soy sauce
        </li>
        <li>
            .5 tsp sesame oil
        </li>
        <li>
            1-2 cloves minced garlic
        </li>
        <li>
            .5 tsp olive oil
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tsp chopped cilantro
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tsp sesame seeds, toasted
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Peel or scrub the cucumbers (whichever you prefer) and cut them into 2 to 3 inch sticks. Put them into a large mixing bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir the rest of the ingredients (except the sesame seeds) in a small bowl to make the dressing.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain any water that may have seeped out of the cucumbers and toss in the dressing. Once the cucumbers are coated, garnish with sesame seeds (if using) and serve immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
            When I made this today it was about 97 degrees outside, and I chilled the cucumbers for about 15 minutes in the fridge before tossing them together. I served the salad with a mildly sweet plum wine we bought while in Chengdu. The dish is light, cooling, and tasty!
